# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project predicting medical insurance prices.

## Project Summary

This project aims to develop a model that can predict the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoker status, region, and other relevant features. 

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project is the **Medical Insurance Price Prediction Dataset**, which is publicly available. It consists of various features and the corresponding insurance price for each individual.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following directories:

* **data**: Contains the downloaded and preprocessed medical insurance dataset.
* **models**: Houses the implementation of different machine learning models for price prediction.
* **evaluation**: Provides scripts for evaluating the performance of the trained models.
* **visualization**: Contains code for generating visualizations of the data and model results.
* **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone [invalid URL removed]
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - The `data` directory contains scripts for downloading and preprocessing the dataset.
    - You may need to modify these scripts depending on the specific data source and format.

2. **Model Training**:
    - The `models` directory contains implementations of various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
    - Each model has a separate script for training and saving the model.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - The `evaluation` directory provides scripts for evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

4. **Visualization**:
    - The `visualization` directory contains code for generating visualizations of the data and model results.
    - These visualizations can help in understanding the relationships between features and insurance price.
